# Introduction to Web Scraping with AWS

This project provides a scalable web scraping solution using AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and AWS Lambda. Aimed at providing a comprehensive guide, it demonstrates how to deploy a web scraping application that leverages the power of AWS services to efficiently gather data from the web. For a full walkthrough of how to deploy this code, see my Notion page [here](https://peridot-caper-43a.notion.site/Introduction-to-Web-Scraping-with-AWS-ECR-and-Lambda-49ea8eeb6d1a403a999bccf7be76aaa3?pvs=4).

### Features

- **AWS ECR Integration**: Utilizes AWS ECR to store and manage Docker images that contain the web scraping code and dependencies.
- **Serverless Deployment**: Leverages AWS Lambda for running web scraping tasks, offering high scalability and efficient resource use.
- **Automated Workflow**: Includes steps for automating the deployment and execution process, making the solution easy to maintain and scale.
- **Application Monitoring**: Implements AWS Application Insights for monitoring the application's health and performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of web scraping and AWS services

### Setup and Deployment

1. **Docker Image Creation**: Build a Docker image containing the web scraping script and its dependencies.
2. **ECR Repository Setup**: Create an ECR repository and push the Docker image.
3. **Lambda Function Configuration**: Set up Lambda functions to execute the scraping tasks using the Docker images stored in ECR.
4. **Monitoring and Insights**: Configure Application Insights for monitoring the application's performance.

## Usage

Once deployed, the web scraping tasks can be triggered manually or scheduled using AWS CloudWatch events. This flexibility allows for regular data collection without manual intervention.

## Final Thoughts

This project represents a significant step towards leveraging cloud computing for web scraping. By combining AWS ECR and Lambda, we've established a scalable, efficient framework for data collection. Looking forward, we're excited about the potential to integrate this data with AI services, enhancing our capabilities and insights.
